# What is this about?

[Matz](https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz) says "Ruby Is Nice So We Are Nice." So let's be nice to our host city, the beautiful city of New Orleans! I talked to the lovely people at the [Greater New Orleans Foundation](https://www.gnof.org), a [Guidestar Gold rated](https://www.guidestar.org/profile/72-0408921) charity, and they would really appreciate our support.

There are two specific funds the recommended:

* **NEW ORLEANS WORKS (NOW):** NOW works with employers and the workforce education and training community to ensure that New Orleans residents are qualified for tomorrowâ€™s careers.
* **SECOND CHANCE:** This program helps people leaving the criminal justice system, enabling them to overcome hurdles so they can get back on their feet.

By entering "RubyConf" they'll know it came from us, and I can find out how much we raised.
