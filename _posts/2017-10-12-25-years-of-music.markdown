# 25 Years of Music

Ok I'm doing this thing, songs from each year, a week (or maybe 2?) at a time, 25 years starting in 1992. Want to join me? To keep it simple I just created a collaborative spotify playlist, people can add whatever they want that enjoyed some popularity in 1992. Sorry only spotify, it's what I use.

I just started it off with random songs I recognized from a list of hits on wikipedia. Some I like, some just remind me of that time.
